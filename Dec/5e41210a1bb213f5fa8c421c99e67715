A trusting woman who left her car on idle while she closed her front gate was left shaken after three opportunistic men hijacked the vehicle in Jerrier Road on Wednesday morning.The woman was leaving to go to work from her home in Raisethorpe at around 9 am, when the incident occurred.The woman&rsquo;s landlord, Hillary Athiah Rajah, said he was walking toward the front yard when he heard her scream.&ldquo;She screamed when she realised the men were already in her car and I ran down to help her,&rdquo; Rajah said.The surveillance footage of the incident, that had already been shared more than 100 times on social media by late Wednesday afternoon, shows the woman running back towards the car and opening the driver&rsquo;s door to grab the key from the hijacker. But a man sitting in the front passenger seat of her white Hyundai i10 gets out of the car and pushes her away from the driver.Rajah said he saw the passenger jumping back into the car and when he got close to the car, Rajah managed to open the back door.&ldquo;I opened the door and tried to pull the other passenger out of the car, but the man in the front pulled out a firearm for me,&rdquo; he said.Rajah said the men then drove off with the vehicle.&ldquo;My tenant was quite shaken up, but I jumped into my car and drove into Raisethorpe where I found a policeman who sent a distress message on the radio,&rdquo; Rajah said.The woman&rsquo;s handbag and cellphone was also stolen.Rajah said he believed the three men were in the area to conduct another crime, but grabbed the opportunity when they saw the woman leave her car unattended.uMgungundlovu North Cluster police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said the vehicle was recovered in just over an hour near Table Mountain.&ldquo;The car was found abandoned in the Table Mountain area. It was not damaged, but the three men are still at large,&rdquo; Ebrahim said.Visit The Witness Facebook page to view the footage of the hijacking.
