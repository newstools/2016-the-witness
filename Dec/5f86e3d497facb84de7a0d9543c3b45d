Independent Examinations Board (IEB) matriculants shone again this year and the pass rate improved slightly compared to last year.There was an overall pass rate of 98,67% &mdash; compared to last year&rsquo;s pass rate of 98,30% &mdash; with all IEB candidates achieving a pass good enough to enter tertiary studies.Counting pupils throughout the country, and including Swaziland, Namibia and Mozambique, 11 725 full-time and part-time pupils wrote the independent examinations in October and November this year.&ldquo;The IEB is proud of the achievements of the class of 2016. With a commitment to hard work over 12 years of schooling, supported by a dedicated cohort of teachers and parents, these learners have achieved the first major milestone in their learning careers,&rdquo; said CEO of the IEB, Anne Oberholzer.About 87,61% of the candidates achieved tertiary entry to study toward a degree; 9,83% qualified for entry to study toward a diploma and 1,23% achieved their entry to study at the Higher Certificate level.Oberholzer said the performance of the class of 2016 in Applied Mathematics was &ldquo;very pleasing&rdquo;.In all 1 407 pupils from IEB schools and 1 275 pupils from state schools wrote the Advanced Mathematics examination and achieved an 87,9% pass rate.From a total of 652 pupils who wrote Advanced English, 98,12% achieved a pass mark of 40% and above, while all who wrote Advanced Afrikaans achieved a mark of 40% and above.KwaZulu-Natal had 36 schools and 2 035 pupils who participated in the IEB National Senior Certificate (NSC) examinations.Gauteng had the most pupils who wrote the independent examination &mdash; 6 002 pupils.The increase in the number of examination venues to 237 from 209 in 2015 was due to 10 new schools joining the IEB, as well as the fact that some institutions operated nationally with multiple examination venues accommodating pupils around the country.Umalusi monitored all aspects of the 2016 examination process and declared the results fair and valid.&ldquo;The 2016 IEB examinations have been conducted without any incidents that challenged the integrity of the process or the credibility of the results,&rdquo; Oberholzer said.Moving forward, Oberholzer emphasised protecting the integrity of education, saying that parents should be vigilant when choosing a school for their children.&ldquo;The incidence of dishonesty across many education systems is on the increase.&ldquo;In South Africa, the past few years have exposed schools whose interest in cheating far exceeds their desire to equip learners with the skills and knowledge they need,&rdquo; she said.In the Midlands, Hilton College, St John&rsquo;s DSG, Michaelhouse, The Wykeham Collegiate, Epworth and St Anne&rsquo;s Diocesan College featured a number of top pupils.Those who want to submit their examination papers for remarking have until January 10 to do so and results will be released on February 1 next year.The closing date for pupils who qualify to enrol for the supplementary examination to submit their applications is February 6 next year.
