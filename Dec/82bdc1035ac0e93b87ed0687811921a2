Following Tuesday&rsquo;s armed robbery at the Liberty Midlands Mall, employees at various stores questioned how the gang gained access to the staff and delivery parking space at the rear of the building.They said public access to that area was recently closed when the third phase of the mall upgrade began about a month ago.&ldquo;The only way we can get into that parking is if we have a ticket which is like an access card. If we do not, we have to buzz the operator who has access to a camera and explain who we are and why we want access,&rdquo; one staff member said.&ldquo;You either need an access card, a parking card or permission from security to enter.&rdquo;Staff members said they heard rumours that the security guard stationed at the boom gate to the rear entrance was &ldquo;in the toilet&rdquo; when the robbers entered.
