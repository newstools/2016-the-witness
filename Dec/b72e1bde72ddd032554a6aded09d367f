A Raisethorpe family have showed the Christmas spirit by creating and sharing a festive haven for children in their neighbourhood.Kerooshan and Rishen Pather, under the strict guidance of their mother Roshnie, spent over a week sculpting and building a Christmas tree and a life-sized Santa Claus and putting up festive lights. A dress-maker by trade, Roshnie said an accident at work in 2005 almost &ldquo;cancelled&rdquo; their Christmas celebrations for the year. &ldquo;But the next year when I was better I wanted to give my children a full Christmas experience and I started making everything from scratch,&rdquo; Pather said. She said in previous years, she built a manger and a sleigh. The 3,5 metre high Christmas tree, which can be seen as you enter Raisethorpe, was also made from odds and ends lying around the house. &ldquo;We have many people from the neighbourhood who come by to see our decorations every year. The children just love it,&rdquo; Pather said. She said the family also hosted a tree lighting ceremony for the neighbourhood. &ldquo;We had speakers out and everyone was dancing,&rdquo; she said. You can also visit the Christmas display, in Lahore Road, opposite the Raisethorpe Sasol garage.
