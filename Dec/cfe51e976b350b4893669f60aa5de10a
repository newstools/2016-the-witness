Over 900 University of KwaZulu-Natal students, and some parents, have signed an online petition against the call by the institution for students to rewrite a final examination.UKZN students who wrote the Economics 202 exam last week were told on Wednesday they would have to rewrite the paper after the examination was &ldquo;compromised&rdquo;.It was not made clear to the students how the examination was compromised but students said they believed the examination paper was &ldquo;leaked&rdquo; by lecturers.&ldquo;Rumour has it that in one of the revision lectures, the lecturer gave out answers for 30 multiple choice questions,&rdquo; said a student who asked not to be named.The exam was written last week on the Westville and Pietermaritzburg campuses.In an e-mail from the School of Accounting Economics &amp; Finance, students were told that the matter was being thoroughly investigated.They said they had &ldquo;no choice but to declare the main examination written on Saturday, 3rd December null and void&rdquo;.The e-mail says a replacement exam would be set on December 15 on both campuses and said if students could not make the date for the replacement examination, they could defer to the supplementary examination session in January.&ldquo;We express our extreme disappointment in those who compromised the integrity of the main examination: you have seriously disadvantaged all the honest students within your cohort.&ldquo;This is a serious matter and any students found guilty of any wrongdoing will be subjected to the university disciplinary processes,&rdquo; it added.Another student, who also asked not to be named, said it was not the students&rsquo; fault that lecturers divulged answers.&ldquo;I believe this is very unfair. I am appalled at UKZN,&rdquo; he said.Students posted their reasons for refusing to write the replacement paper on the online petition.UKZN spokesperson Lesiba Seshoka said the decision to rewrite the exam was &ldquo;in the interests of maintaining academic integrity&rdquo; after evidence came to light that the exam was compromised.&ldquo;The university has not received any petition in this regard and sincerely regrets any inconvenience caused,&rdquo; said Seshoka.
