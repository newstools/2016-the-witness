A Howick man is putting the final touches on the country&rsquo;s first documentary on South African butterflies.Howick local Clive Curtis of the Lepidopterist (the study of moths and butterflies) Society of Africa began filming the documentary in 2012 in a bid to bridge the gap between the knowledge about butterflies among ordinary citizens and scientists.Curtis&rsquo;s love for butterflies and insects started when he was 10 years old and living on a farm in Otto&rsquo;s Bluff with his family.Soon, his interest in butterflies grew and he began collecting them and reading up on different species and their habitats.In 2002, Curtis started work as a field guide, compiling species guides for KwaZulu-Natal game reserves.While working as a field guide, he said he started filming safaris and expeditions for clients, and once he realised that the general public did not have a lot of information on the winged creatures, he decided to &ldquo;bridge the gap&rdquo; by making a documentary.In 2012, he started gathering footage of common and rare butterflies from the foothills of the Drakensberg, to Kar&shy;kloof and even Pietermaritzburg&rsquo;s Butterflies for Africa facility.He said the documentary would enable people to view footage of different butterflies&rsquo; behaviour that had not been caught on film before.&ldquo;I wanted to make something interesting, especially since there are no documentaries on South African butterflies,&rdquo; he said.Curtis said people are more aware of conservation with a boom in cultivating mostly indigenous gardens.The documentary will provide information on what plants attract which butterflies as well as fill the &ldquo;void&rdquo; of information with field guides in reserves, he said.&ldquo;The documentary takes a look at the general butterfly ecology.&ldquo;It looks at their lives from start to finish, as well as interesting facts about different species.&ldquo;It will look at how to identify different butterflies, where to look for them and their habitats from coastal forests to high-altitude grasslands,&rdquo; he said.Curtis said the film will also explain the difference between moths and butterflies, look at conservation models for rare butterflies and give an overview of their lives.&ldquo;The majority of the documentary was filmed in the Midlands, as well as the Kalahari, the North Coast of KZN, Mpumalanga and Limpopo.&ldquo;I love being in wild places and to go in search of butterflies, especially the rarer species, is a challenge.&ldquo;It is also an excuse to go to places you would not usually go.&rdquo;He said there are numerous scenes in the documentary that have &ldquo;never been filmed or photographed&rdquo; before.The documentary should be ready for release in March next year with a percentage of the proceeds going to butterfly conservation projects, he said.For a sneak peak of the documentary, follow South African Butterflies &mdash; The Journey of a Documentary on Facebook.
