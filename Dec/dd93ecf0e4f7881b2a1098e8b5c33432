Users took to social media on Tuesday to comment on the breaking news on The Witness Facebook page about the armed robbery.Coetzee Pather said: &ldquo;The mall is not security tight. I gained entrance once at the third entry point and drove around the mall and came to the undercover parking. Then went to the reception area and got a ticket. My thoughts at that moment, so easy for criminals to enter the mall, and here is a robbery.&rdquo;Gilda Findlay said: &ldquo;My daughter is there! Apparently an armed robbery at a Jewellery Store!! Cops riding their bikes in the mall looking for the suspects. Gates closed - no entry! Hope no-one got hurt!!!Tatiana Wickham said : Sadly, I could see this was coming. Just a few weeks ago walking out the Mall, there were 2 guys walking out in front of us with long knives that they carry in a leather thing. We told Security and they just looked at us. Those same 2 guys walked right past him. Hope everyone is safeCheiz-leigh Naidoo said: This is the very same car that I had reported to the police just this week that I had seen driving in and out of our road rather slowly.
