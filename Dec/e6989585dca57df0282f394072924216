Lauretta du Preez of Eldorado Place crochets what she calls &ldquo;love me dolls&rdquo; for abused children, and says nothing gives her greater reward, as children have always been her first love. &ldquo;It has been a life-long dream of mine to work with children and I don&rsquo;t like to see them getting hurt, which is why I decided to make these dolls to supply to children.&ldquo;Ever since I was a teenager I loved working with children. I wanted to be a social worker, but realised I would get too emotionally involved. Thereafter I wanted to become a pre-primary school teacher, but there were no finances for that.&ldquo;I started making the dolls earlier this year when my friend, Debbie Pienaar, got a crochet pattern for a doll. As we crocheted together and she taught me, I realised that there are little ones that might appreciate these. &ldquo;However, it was not until I attended the Brave Women&rsquo;s Conference with my sister, and saw Dlalanathi and what they do, that I resolved to dedicate my dolls to abused and traumatised children.&rdquo;Dlalanathi is a non-government organisation that focuses on the well being of vulnerable children.&ldquo;When I started making the dolls I couldn&rsquo;t stop. To date I have made almost 30 dolls. I have had to slow down recently because I had a slipped disk on my neck. &ldquo;Oddly enough, it has been finding a space to donate to that has proven to be challenging. &ldquo;When I first got the idea I contacted a social worker with whom I&rsquo;d hoped I could work with to distribute the dolls, but she never got back to me.&ldquo;Then I tried Grey&rsquo;s Hospital, but I was told of the long procedural steps one needed to take in order to donate something like this. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no giving up and currently I&rsquo;m communicating with the magistrate&rsquo;s court as I heard they will be hosting a Christmas party and are taking donations for underprivileged and abused children.&ldquo;We as adults are the cement that holds them together. Our love and caring is what makes them loving and caring adults,&rdquo; she said of children.
