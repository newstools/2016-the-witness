Funda Nenja&rsquo;s founder, professional dog trainer Adrienne Olivier, known as &ldquo;the dog lady&rdquo; is a well-known and friendly face in Pietermaritzburg.&ldquo;I was born in the Eastern Cape, and moved to Pietermaritzburg with my family in 1980. My family were farming in Thornville and I taught at Scottsville Primary School for a number of years but stopped after I had my third child.&ldquo;I decided then to make my hobby my job and founded the township dog initiative, Funda Nenja (learn with your dog) in 2009. Funda Nenja&rsquo;s vision is to create a bond between children and their dogs and make an impact on the children themselves, making them nurturing, responsible young people. &ldquo;I love the small city feeling. Unlike bigger cities, there is a sense of community here. You get to know people and businesses and meet a wide variety of people who live in Pietermaritzburg.&ldquo;To a large extent, Pietermaritzburg people are unpretentious and down to earth.&ldquo;It is a slower way of life here and we have the country right on our doorstep.&ldquo;Pietermaritzburg is my home. Being a smaller city makes it easier to make an impact on people&rsquo;s lives. I am pleased that I am able to do something I am passionate about every day in a place I love.&ldquo;My family call me the dog lady but the dogs know me as the liver lady.&rdquo;
