Thieves could not break open the locks at Lock and Key Solutions, so they opted for the window. Mrs South Africa 2016 contestant Maritsa Gouws said she was grateful her family were safe after thieves ransacked the family business on Friday night. Lock and Key Solutions is situated at the corner of Peter Kerchhoff and Boom streets. Gouws said they recently extended the business property and had fitted new carpets on Friday. &ldquo;There were contractors here throughout Friday during the renovations,&rdquo; she said. She said she placed her two laptops and external hard drive in a metal cupboard in her office and left the office late on Friday. But on Saturday when she returned to work, she found the window shattered, her burglar bars bent and some of her electronic equipment missing.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s as if they [the thieves] knew exactly where to go. They took my laptop, desktop computer, external hard drive and some change bags. &ldquo;They even stole my pump for the fish tank,&rdquo; she said. Gouws said this was the first break-in the business had experienced in seven years. On her computer and external hard drive, Gouws said she had all the company&rsquo;s details, copies of her family&rsquo;s identity documents, the business accounting details and personal family photographs. &ldquo;This is just all highly inconvenient. Especially around the festive period. &ldquo;I know it is going to be costly, but we will have to increase the security here,&rdquo; she said. She gave an assurance that clients of Lock and Key Solutions would not have to worry as the business accountant has the &ldquo;important&rdquo; details. &ldquo;I am not too worried about what the thieves may have that would be detrimental to the business and its clients, but I just know that we will be spending the first days in the new year doing a whole lot of data capturing,&rdquo; Gouws said. She said she was more concerned that &ldquo;irreplaceable&rdquo; family photographs and details were stolen. &ldquo;This is the last thing we needed during Christmas, but one thing is for sure &mdash; they cannot get through our locks,&rdquo; Gouws laughed. She said the break-in did not make her bitter, but &ldquo;definitely&rdquo; taught her to be more vigilant. &ldquo;It does not matter who you are or what you do, there is crime everywhere. &ldquo;I just want to warn people to be vigilant when they have contractors around and learn from my experience,&rdquo; she said.
