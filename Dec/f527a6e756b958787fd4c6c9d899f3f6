There are plans to establish a new linen factory in one of Pietermaritzburg&rsquo;s suburbs. The prime land situated in Mountain Rise is expected to be sold to the owners of Parklane Linen to build a bedlinen factory.The municipal-owned land, near Tucker and Apollo roads in Mountain Rise, is situated directly opposite upmarket houses and will be sold via private treaty.The city is calling upon the public to comment on the sale of the land and the conversion of it from residentially zoned to industrially marked land.In an application to the Msunduzi council, Hajra Bibi Essa said she wanted to purchase the residentially zoned land to build a linen manufacturing factory.Essa is the owner of African Diya Trading 02 cc, popularly known by its trade name Parklane Linen.In her motivation to purchase the land (6 268 square metres), Essa said she wants to build a factory that would supply her retail store and others in the province. She said the land is &ldquo;strategically well located&rdquo; to meet the needs of her business.She anticipates the factory would create at least 30 to 50 new employment opportunities for local people.The land is valued at R2 495 000 but Essa said in her motivation letter that Msunduzi Municipality would benefit from an increase in income from rates and service charges.The advertisement for public comment was published in The Witness last week where the municipality gave notice of their intention to sell the land to African Diya Trading 02 cc.The public has until January 13 to comment or raise objections with the acting city manager, Sizwe Hadebe.In the published advertisement, the city said the plan, together with supporting documents, will be available for inspection at the land management office on the second floor of City Hall.Council documents revealed that all municipal departments showed no objection to the sale of the land by private treaty but the municipal legal department expressed concern that they were informally made to understand that all land sales should be done via tender.&ldquo;&hellip; but Legal Services has not had sight of this,&rdquo; read the comment to council.
