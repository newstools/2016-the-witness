A traumatic ordeal that ended in absolute relief. This was the scene on Wednesday when a terrified nine-year-old boy, who was abducted by two men who hijacked his parents&rsquo; car on Wednesday afternoon, was rescued after Winterton farmers followed and stopped the vehicle.It is believed that the boy and his family were travelling to a game reserve in the midlands when two men, one armed with a firearm, stopped the car.The exact details are unclear at this stage however, the mother, father and sibling of the young boy managed to escape, while the car was believed to have been driving through Ladysmith, before the hijackers sped off towards Colenso.A source, who could not be named, said the two men were travelling with the child in the back seat of the car.An alert was sent out, and it is believed the Estcourt and surrounding farming community began blocking most of the intersections before they spotted the car coming off the N3 on the Winterton off-ramp.A chase ensued and the hijackers were eventually stopped when they crashed into one of the farmers&rsquo; vehicles near the Loskop flyover.The hijackers tried to reverse but then crashed into another farmer&rsquo;s vehicle.The child was apparently immediately pulled from the car and taken to safety while the farmers and other community members guarded the hijackers until police arrived.The source said the child was shaken from the incident but was unharmed.KwaZulu-Natal police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said the vehicle had been recovered but no case had been opened by the time of going press last night.
