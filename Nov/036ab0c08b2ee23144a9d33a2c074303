He had attended a crisis conference in Britain.The founder of internationally recognised humanitarian group Gift of the Givers, Sooliman was awarded the accolade for his groundbreaking work last night.&ldquo;Africa is being recognised for our capabilities. To receive this award is like being audited and passing every stringent test,&rdquo; Sooliman said.The award ceremony took place in London on a ship outside the iconic Savoy Hotel last night. The event marked the closing of the 10th annual Global Residence and Citizenship Conference at the hotel.The Global Citizen Award was given to Sooliman in recognition of his tireless efforts to develop the Gift of the Givers Foundation into Africa&rsquo;s largest disaster relief organisation.&ldquo;This award is not about us, it is about the world taking notice of Africa,&rdquo; he said.The organisation has raised more than R2 billion in live-saving aid for 42 countries around the world, including war-ravaged states such as Syria, Libya, Sudan, Somalia, and Bosnia.His team of 200 provides medical assistance, equipment and supplies, as well as high-energy and protein supplements, food and water to millions of people each year. During the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the organisation sent four rescue teams and aid materials to the country. At one point in 2011, it was the only international aid group providing food parcels to Somalia, airlifting 180 tons and shipping 2 000 tons of aid.Before leaving for London on Thursday, Sooliman and his team offered their assistance to those who suffered the affects of Johannesburg&rsquo;s floods.&ldquo;This recognition would not have been possible without collective support. My family and my teams who have dedicated themselves to this organisation are the real heroes,&rdquo; he said.Group chairperson of Henley &amp; Partners Dr Christian H.
