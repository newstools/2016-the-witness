The new bride of the Northdale man who shot and killed his wife and daughter before turning the gun on himself, is believed to have died protecting her step-daughter.Aradhana Sinanin (46) was found with a gunshot wound to the head and two others to her body, on a couch in her home, holding the body of her 14-year-old step-daughter Sohini Sinanin.Northdale man Ramesh Sinanin is believed to have shot Aradhana and his daughter Sohini after Aradhana allegedly tried to leave the house with a bag packed for her and her step-daughter.The tragedy is thought to have occurred on Wednesday morning while Aradhana was about to leave for work.A neighbour, who would not be named, said he had heard Sinanin&rsquo;s car &ldquo;idling&rdquo; in the driveway, but there was nobody inside the vehicle.He said he thought Sinanin was warming the car up as it usually had trouble starting, and left with his wife for gym, to return home later.&ldquo;When we got back, the car was still idling. I looked to see if I could spot anyone but there was no one there.&rdquo;The neighbour said he and his wife continued with their day, running errands and, when they returned home early on Wednesday evening, the car had been switched off.The family was found late on Wednesday evening, allegedly by one of Aradhana&rsquo;s sons from her previous marriage.Sohini&rsquo;s uncle, Nikesh Ramcharan, said it was believed that Aradhana was found with her arms around Sohini, as if she were protecting the young teen.Ramcharan, the brother to Ramesh&rsquo;s first wife Neetha, who died a year and a half ago, said Sohini had spent most of her years at his home with his wife and daughter, growing up as their &ldquo;second daughter&rdquo;.Ramcharan said Sohini had taken her mother&rsquo;s death &ldquo;very hard&rdquo; but had started &ldquo;dealing with it&rdquo; over the past two months.He said she seemed happy and had passed her Grade 9 year at Raisethorpe Secondary very well.&ldquo;She spent the day with us on Sunday,&rdquo; said Ramcharan.&ldquo;She was such a bubbly and sweet child, and was always doing things to make people laugh.&ldquo;She loved computer games, skateboarding and just being outside. We all loved her to bits.&rdquo;Ramcharan said there had never been any problems with Sinanin and that he had been a nice guy.&ldquo;We would never have expected him to do something like this. I know he loved his daughter,&rdquo; he said.Police were summoned to the scene on Wednesday evening, allegedly after Aradhana&rsquo;s son from her previous marriage could not get hold of her and went to the house.After finding the door locked, the police were called.Mountain Rise police spokesperson Captain Gay Ebrahim said the police gained entry forcefully into the house, after several attempts to contact the family.After discovering the bodies of Sohini and Aradhana in the lounge, the police found Sinanin&rsquo;s body submerged in a bathtub, with one bullet wound to his head.A firearm was found on his chest.&ldquo;It is alleged that the murders and suicide resulted after a domestic dispute between the couple,&rdquo; said Ebrahim.&ldquo;The Mountain Rise Police are investigating the tragic matter.&rdquo;The neighbour said Sinanin and his new bride mostly kept to themselves but were always friendly to him and his wife.He said Sinanin had lived in the house for around four years and had been &ldquo;a lot happier&rdquo; since his marriage to Aradhana following the death of his first wife.The wife of the neighbour said Aradhana seemed &ldquo;wonderful&rdquo; and that she had invited her to tea this week, to welcome her to the neighbourhood.&ldquo;She gave me a hug and said thank you,&rdquo; she said.Sohini&rsquo;s high school, Raisethorpe Secondary, was left reeling at the news of her death.&ldquo;The school is still in shock,&rdquo; said principal Indran Pillay.&ldquo;We send our sincere condolences to her family, friends and other relatives,&rdquo; the principal added.
