Noma Khumalo, a 22-year-old student teacher in Pietermaritzburg, is proudly representing the city after making the top three contestants on Idols SA season 12.Khumalo auditioned for Idols SA after the children at school, and her band mates of Acoustiq Assassins, encouraged her to follow her dreams.&ldquo;They reminded me that I too had a dream, and I thought let me go and see where the talent the children saw could take me,&rdquo; said the songstress who was born in Empangeni and raised in Ulundi.She is completing her Bachelor of Education degree at Unisa, and hopes to land a recording deal and pursue a career in music and entertainment.&ldquo;There are so many opportunities in the entertainment industry and I want to pursue them,&rdquo; said Khumalo, who started singing in choirs at the age of seven.At 14 years of age, her choir conductor told her he believed she would &ldquo;take on bigger songs and lead solos with a big voice&rdquo;. In high school she sang with the KZN Midlands Youth Choir and was given the platform to lead songs with other vocalists.Khumalo admits that she was afraid to sing in front of Randall and the other judges &mdash; especially after watching their comments over the years.&ldquo;One of the scariest experiences is finding out how far I can push myself. One of my toughest challenges has been to sing and dance at the same time,&rdquo; Khumalo said.&ldquo;Rehearsals are very important and working with our vocal coach, Malie Kelly, as she helps us get more comfortable with the songs. &ldquo;Rehearsals are amazing. Songs are challenges and sometimes you need someone to help you see beyond the challenge.&rdquo;&ldquo;In this field there is always something new to learn. We learn every day about the entertainment industry and that hard work pays off,&rdquo; she added.Some of the memorable moments throughout her journey on Idols SA include meeting celebrities, working with other contestants and forming relationships with people in the music industry.To vote for Khumalo to make it to the finals, SMS the number 04 to 37400 (each SMS costs R1,50) or add Idols SA on WeChat and follow the prompts (this is free, limited to 100 votes).
