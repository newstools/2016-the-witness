If you were planning on taking on the 2017 Comrades Marathon, you will have to wait another year.The Comrades Marathon Association (CMA) said that the entry cap of 20 000 athletes was reached on Tuesday morning, necessitating the closure of the entry process. Runner Michael Makhudu, who couldn&rsquo;t hide his excitement, told The&nbsp; Witness : &lsquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve known that I wanted to do the race a few months now, but I heard that the entries were closed. I&rsquo;d given up on entering until my friend told me this earlier [on Tuesday] that there&rsquo;s about 33 entries left and that we&rsquo;d better enter quickly. &ldquo;So I said to him, Shaun, can you enter for me because I&rsquo;m driving and he entered for me. He was going to enter himself after me but as he attempted to enter, the system shut him out. So, I feel very, very lucky. I&rsquo;m super excited. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t started training yet, because I have a back strain. I almost didn&rsquo;t enter, but now I feel like I&rsquo;m in with a second chance.&rdquo;Entries for the Comrades 2017 had opened on September 1 and were expected to close today, but the targeted 20 000 cap was reached on Tuesday.Makhudu expressed his great intention to finish the race in the top 10 next year.&ldquo;It will be my second race and I want to do better this time around. I&rsquo;m not going to be the last one to cross the line. I&rsquo;m definitely going to train hard and finish the race in time. I want to be in the top 50%. &ldquo;Last time, I finished around 10:49,03. This time around, I&rsquo;m aiming to finish in the top 10, but I hope I haven&rsquo;t left the training too late.&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to the day. I now feel I kind of know what I&rsquo;m getting into. I like KwaZulu-Natal. I&rsquo;ve done eight Dusis already. I&rsquo;ve done the Comrades Marathon before. I did 2008 which was my one and only,&rdquo; he added.Next year&rsquo;s race will be an &ldquo;up-run&rdquo;, starting at the Durban City Hall at 5.30 am and finishing at 5.30 pm at the Scottsville Race Course in Pietermaritzburg, covering a distance of around 88 km. The 92nd edition of the ultimate human race is expected to once again boost the province&rsquo;s economy by a whopping R600 million.Meanwhile, the marathon&rsquo;s organisers confirmed that the round figure on Tuesday stood at 20 002 entries, excluding postal entries.&lsquo;&lsquo;As we currently stand we have reached the 20 000 cap targeted for the event but there are still postal entries yet to be counted. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at around 21 000 entries overall,&rsquo;&rsquo; said the CMA media liaison Delaine Cools.
