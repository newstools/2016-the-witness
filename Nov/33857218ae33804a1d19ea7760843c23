The injury demon struck the Bafana Bafana camp on Wednesday when Tebogo Langerman and Dean Furman were released from the squad after hurting themselves in training.The team is currently in Polokwane where they are preparing themselves to take on Senegal in a crucial, must-win World Cup qualifier where they simply have to trump their rivals in the game after dropping points in their opening clash in Burkina Faso a month ago.According to KickOff, Landerman picked up a hamstring problem, while Furman was carrying a rib injury from his last club game for SuperSport United.While Belgium-based striker Lars Veldwijk will have the eyes of the nation looking at him, the return of Daine Klate to the national team has also been a talking point ahead of the game against the Senegalese.But humble as ever Klate, the most decorated footballer in domestic football, said while he was enjoying being back into the national fold, he was there to be a team player and help the team pick up their first win as they bid to qualify for the games in Russia in two years.&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not about me, and I&rsquo;m not going to talk about myself and what my expectations are and what I need to prove. It&rsquo;s definitely not about me. It&rsquo;s all about us in the camp and all of us are going to do duty on Saturday,&rdquo; said the on-form Bidvest Wits winger.&ldquo;We have to bring three points and nothing is more important that the cause of the team, so I think in all fairness, and out of respect of all my teammates and for the country, I can&rsquo;t talk about myself when I&rsquo;m representing the country and when I&rsquo;m wearing these clothes,&rdquo; said Klate.The 31-year-old was, however unable to take part in training on Wednesday as he was nursing a bruise to the leg, but was expected to recover in time for the clash against the Senegalese.On their quest to make South African football great again, Shakes Mashaba and his troops will encounter hotshot Liverpool striker Sadio Mane, who has been in inspired form for his club, and will be looking to transfer it to the international stage.Mane has fired Liverpool to the top of the Premier League table, and it will be up to Kakamas-born Rivaldo Coetzee to stop him in his tracks. In all reality, in order to stop Mane, Mashaba may have to build a wall around the former Southampton man, who will be looking to have a big influence on the outcome of the game. South Africa and Senegal have met each other seven times in the past, with both teams winning two games, and three of them ending in draws. Mashaba and every South African football fan will be hoping that the home team can pick up their third win against the 2002 World Cup quarter-finalists.The clash at Peter Mokaba Stadium will kick off at 3&thinsp;pm on Saturday. Senegal sit at the top of Group D with one win, while South Africa are second, and have one point.
