Despite the municipality&rsquo;s efforts to constantly clean up rubbish accumulating on the side of Copesville Drive, people continue to dump their waste there.Scattered on the side of the main road entering Copesville from the Table Mountain intersection are piles of rubbish spilling on to the road. The debris comprises of old broken car bumpers, water pipes, broken toilets, broken bricks, sawdust, pieces of torn clothes, pillows and fabric.Diane Carson told The&nbsp;Witness that she drives past the dumping site every morning and afternoon on her way to and from work.&ldquo;The place is appalling and it gets worse every day. Sometimes the rubbish is scattered across the road,&rdquo; said Carson.&ldquo;I have had nails and screws stuck in my tyres a couple of times from driving past that area and have had to change them because they were damaged.&rdquo;Carson added that she has seen many vehicles off-loading their rubbish in broad daylight and last week, after spotting a man driving a red van dumping his rubbish, she stopped to take a picture of him.&ldquo;The man was off-loading TV boxes and other rubbish from his van. When he saw me taking the picture he confronted me and said what he was doing did not concern me. He was very aggressive,&rdquo; she said.Copesville ward councillor Sphamandla Madlala said they have reported the matter along with other dumping sites in the area to the municipality a number of times.&ldquo;That dumping site has been a problem for over 15 years now, even before I was the councillor.&ldquo;It is not even people from the community dumping rubbish there but companies that come to dump their industrial waste there,&rdquo; said Madlala.The councillor added that the municipality comes regularly to clear the area up but nothing has been done to put a stop to the illegal dumping.The Witness asked Msunduzi Municipality if they had any plans to prevent people and companies from dumping their waste illegally, and if they had any alternative for people to get rid of waste. Municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha responded by saying that they were currently investigating the matter.
