For the fuming motorists travelling through the &ldquo;chaotic mess&rdquo; on New Greytown Road each day, unfortunately the roadworks are here to stay.Msunduzi municipal spokesperson Thobeka Mafumbatha said the refurbishment of the road is a multi-year project and will be done in phases over the next few years.The municipality divided the road into four sections and has so far done work on two of the four sections.Currently the city is removing and replacing the top surface of the road.The roadworks started over a year ago, with intermittent renovations through the year, but now much of the road is excavated and closed to traffic.There are only two lanes open &mdash; one in each direction.Mafumbatha said the project is being conducted in phases to ensure that &ldquo;not much inconvenience&rdquo; is being caused to motorists. She said it would cost too much to do the project all at once &ldquo;because the project is huge&rdquo;.Weather permitting, the resurfacing of the first section will be completed by the end of this month.&ldquo;Currently they are attending to base failures and milling the old asphalt and replacing it with a new and improved mix,&rdquo; she said.But those using the road during rush hour said the way the roadworks are being done in phases is causing them more inconvenience.The excavations begin at the corners of Allandale Drive and New Greytown Road &mdash; a busy route used by many travelling to and from the northern areas.&ldquo;This situation &hellip; has become extremely volatile where many drivers are unsure of the lanes due to there being no road markings,&rdquo; said one frustrated motorist, Yaseen Mahomed.He said in an effort to avoid the uneven road surfaces and potholes, drivers start driving &ldquo;recklessly and dangerously&rdquo;.The road is notorious for the many lives it has claimed through accidents and motorists said the construction has increased the danger.&ldquo;As this route is used by many motorists and public transport operators, it is only a matter of time before something terrible happens,&rdquo; Mahomed said.The tarring of the road, which leads to Copesville and Greytown, was brought to an abrupt halt over three months ago.Mohamed said after the tarring stopped, the road was &ldquo;uneven and unsafe&rdquo;.&ldquo;The tar which was laid was not sealed and then began to erode. This road is used by hundreds of motorists on a daily basis and the uneven and unmarked road surface is forcing motorists to change lanes and brake suddenly.&rdquo;Another frustrated motorist, who asked not to be named, said he used the particular stretch of road to travel to work daily.&ldquo;The condition of the road seems to be deteriorating daily, with gaping potholes and rough surfaces,&rdquo; he said.He said traffic was chaotic especially during peak time in the mornings and afternoons, with many having to drive slowly to avoid damaging their tyres.The situation worsens when taxi drivers drive in the oncoming lanes to avoid the traffic and then create havoc when they try and get back into the right lane when they near the traffic lights, he said.&ldquo;The taxi drivers drive in the oncoming lanes while others sit in the single lane to the robots for up to 20 minutes,&rdquo; he said.
