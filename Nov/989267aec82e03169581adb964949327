A Pietermaritzburg lawyer is in disbelief after he discovered his indigenous Tilapia fish floating belly-up in what appeared to be chlorine-laced water in the pond in his garden last Saturday.Adrian Rall said he had gone into his garden on Saturday morning and spotted white powder at the edge of the pond, where he kept over 100 Tilapia fish.As he got closer to the pond, he realised all the fish were dead and lying on the floor of the pond.He said as the day wore on, the fish floated to the top, covering the surface of the pond.Rall said he suspected that the fish had been poisoned after he saw the white powder at the edge of the pond and on the surface of the water.His wife Michelle said it was &ldquo;unbelievable&rdquo; that someone had come into their property and killed all their fish. &ldquo;It was such a senseless killing,&rdquo; she said.&ldquo;I feel it is so important to have urban areas that are environmentally friendly. Who would do something like this?&rdquo;Rall estimated that at least a litre of what he suspects was chlorine was poured into the pond.Michelle said she thought the pond may have been poisoned to kill the frogs. However, they had not found any dead frogs.She added that their dogs had drunk some of the water on Saturday and were vomiting for the whole day.Although the dogs were fine, over 100 indigenous fish had been killed, she said.
