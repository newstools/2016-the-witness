The one thing that political analysts and insiders are clear on after the ANC&rsquo;s last NEC meeting of the year, is that the party is even more divided than before.The ANC confirmed on Tuesday that its highest decision-making body, the National Executive Committee (NEC), did not support calls for President Jacob Zuma to step down.&ldquo;We affirm him as the president of the party and the country,&rdquo; ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe told journalists during a media briefing on the outcomes of the NEC.UKZN-based political analyst Zakhele Ndlovu said the botched dramatic bid to end Zuma&rsquo;s term will plunge the party into further turmoil.&ldquo;It is clear that the ANC is failing to deal with the issue of divisions. Since the 2007 Polokwane conference, nothing has changed. This will tear the ANC apart,&rdquo; he said.Although Mantashe said he did not expect any mass resignations by those cabinet ministers who supported the motion to remove Zuma, Ndlovu said he expected a fallout in the cabinet.Zuma backers, including the ANC Youth League in KZN, have called for an &ldquo;urgent&rdquo; cabinet reshuffle, calling for the axing of those against Zuma.&ldquo;Obviously it is going to make the relationship between them and Zuma very bad. You cannot work with people you do not trust. I think this would be his [Zuma&rsquo;s] line of thinking,&rdquo; said Ndlovu.With the 2017 national conference getting closer and closer, Ndlovu said it was clear that different camps were positioning themselves.&ldquo;Zuma has become a lame-duck president.&ldquo;By them distancing themselves from him, it increases their chances of being elected should [Cyril] Ramaphosa become the president.&rdquo;A prominent ANC member in KZN who is aligned to those who do not want Zuma to lead the party any longer, described the motion as a victory for his camp.&ldquo;At least people are standing up to the president now. We are not worried about those cabinet posts. They purged us in the KZN cabinet reshuffle and we survived. We will survive this one again,&rdquo; said the ANC member, who asked not to be named.&ldquo;This will give us some courage going to 2017 [ANC national conference].&rdquo;DA leader Mmusi Maimane said the decision taken by the NEC should not come as a surprise.&ldquo;That is because Jacob Zuma is not an anomaly within the ANC, he is the norm: he is only the most vivid manifestation of what the ANC has become &mdash; an irredeemable and toxic mix of corruption, cronyism and nepotism.&ldquo;Furthermore, despite the brave face and united fa&ccedil;ade depicted by Gwede Mantashe, the ANC is more divided now than it has ever been &mdash; and this will only worsen.&ldquo;Zuma clearly holds all the power in the ANC, and the majority of the ANC believe that he is the right man to take them forward. We can never trust an ANC that keeps Zuma through all he has done. While the ANC continues to fight amongst themselves, our economy is hanging by a thread,&rdquo; he said.
